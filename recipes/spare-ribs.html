        The finest beef bbq spare ribs in the universe is here!

        These baby back ribs cooked in a crockpot are the best I've had, short
        of the actual grilling method of course! This is a very simple recipe
        that I came up with a few years ago. It's not rocket science, just ribs
        cooked in the slow cooker and finished with barbeque sauce in the oven.
        This is what I do when I want ribs during the week and have to work all
        day. I'm eating them within 30 minutes of getting home, and they turn
        out perfect every time!
